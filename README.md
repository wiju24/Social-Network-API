# Social Network API

## Description

This interactive Back-End application allows users to manage friends, their thoughts and any reactions using the Back-End applications, Insomnia and MongoDB Compass. With the use of Insomnia, users will be able to create/remove any users and thoughts while creating/removing their reactions and friends. In addition, the same users who create an entire list of those listed above, will have the information stored in the Database using the NoSql MongoDB Compass application. Leverage both technologies with the information with this application to create an organized and polished Social Network API.
